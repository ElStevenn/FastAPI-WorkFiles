# Statistical Calculator API

## Description:
- Create a web application using FAST API that allows users to perform basic statistical calculations on numerical datasets. The application will accept data in the form of lists of numbers and provide statistical results such as mean, median, standard deviation, and sum of the entered numbers using the NumPy library.

## Project Features:

1- Simple User Interface: Create a web interface where users can input their numerical data in the form of lists. You can use HTML forms in conjunction with FAST API to collect the data.

2- Input Validation: Ensure that the entered data is valid, i.e., real numbers. FAST API enables you to efficiently validate and transform inputs.

3- Statistical Calculations: Use the NumPy library to perform statistical calculations on the datasets provided by users. Calculate mean, median, standard deviation, and sum of the numbers.

4- JSON Responses: Present the statistical results in JSON format so that the API can send them back to the user interface.

5- API Routes: Define API routes in FAST API to handle different statistical operations, such as calculating mean, median, standard deviation, etc. Design the routes intuitively so that users specify which calculation they want to perform.

6- Documentation: Utilize FAST API's automatic documentation generation to clearly describe how users can interact with the API and what to expect from each route.

7- NumPy Implementation: Use NumPy's functions to perform the statistical calculations. NumPy is an efficient library for numerical operations in Python.

8- Error Handling: Handle potential errors, such as incorrect data, missing data, etc., and provide appropriate responses in case of errors.

## Duration:
This project should take approximately a month to complete, depending on your level of experience with FAST API and NumPy. You can dedicate time to designing the user interface, implementing API routes, connecting with NumPy to perform calculations, and conducting thorough testing to ensure everything works as expected.

Remember that, in addition to technical aspects, it's important to consider user interface design and user experience to create an attractive and user-friendly application. Good luck with your project!
